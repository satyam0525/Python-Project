# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify key factors that influence customer attrition and to build insights that can help businesses improve customer retention.

The analysis is performed using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem where customers stop using a company’s service.  
In this project, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning–based analysis** to understand customer behavior and predict churn.

This project demonstrates real-world **data analysis and ML workflow** used by Data Analysts and Data Scientists.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:
- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Service usage details
- Churn status (Yes / No)

Target variable:
- **Churn** → Indicates whether a customer has left the service

## 🔍 Steps Performed in the Notebook

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Basic data inspection (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`)

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Data type corrections
- Encoding categorical variables

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn distribution analysis
- Relationship between churn and key features
- Visualizations using bar plots, count plots, and histograms

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Label encoding / one-hot encoding
- Feature selection for model building

### 5️⃣ Model Building
- Train-test split
- Applied machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - (Optional) Decision Tree / Random Forest

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

## 📈 Key Insights

- Identified important factors influencing customer churn
- Observed patterns between service usage and churn behavior
- Built a predictive model to classify churn customers
